# leap_motion_controller

This ros package is not done, not general and not meant to be used by itself. It's a companion package to my other package kb_mover and its dependencies, forming a suite that allows VR and leapmotion integration within rviz. The set-up is long and involved, and therefore will not be fully detailed in this readme yet. If you want to take a look regardless, these are the other packages involved:

- [https://github.com/reach-satori/kb-mover]
